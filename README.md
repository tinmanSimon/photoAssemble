# photoAssemble
This project produces photo mosaic effect using the target photo and image lib that you provide.

To use, you need python3, and install whatever package it's missing.
Because you might have thousands of images, you may first want to reduce the lib image quality. reduceImagesQualityAndSave function helps.
Then you can call assembleImg to produce the photo mosaic result.
note you can change the params of assembleImg to tailor the details of your photo mosaic.
